# Poker Hands

This is a sample project written for an interview with Winona IT. See the
[accompanying PDF file](Sample%20Code%20Project%20-%20Poker%20Hands.pdf).

The app helps a user determine which poker player has won the pot. A frontend application in /app
is a basic interface written in React. The backend is an ASP.NET Core web API application in the
root directory. The API has a single endpoint (POST /hand_comparisons) which accepts and responds
with JSON.

## Setup

- Install dotnet.
- Run `dotnet run` in the project directory.
